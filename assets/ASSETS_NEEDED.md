## App Store Assets Required

You need to create these image files before submitting to app stores:

### 1. App Icon (assets/icon.png)
- Size: 1024x1024 px
- Format: PNG
- No transparency
- No rounded corners (stores handle this)
- Should be the ResetDopa logo

### 2. Splash Screen (assets/splash.png)
- Size: 1242x2436 px (iPhone X resolution)
- Format: PNG
- Shows while app loads
- Should have ResetDopa branding

### 3. Adaptive Icon for Android (assets/adaptive-icon.png)
- Size: 1024x1024 px
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Only the logo/icon part (will be masked by Android)

### 4. Notification Icon (assets/notification-icon.png)
- Size: 96x96 px
- Format: PNG with transparency
- White icon on transparent background
- Simple, recognizable shape

### Quick Tools to Create These:
- Canva (free templates): https://www.canva.com/create/app-icons/
- Figma (design from scratch)
- Adobe Express
- Or hire on Fiverr ($5-20 for a set)

### Temporary Fix:
I've created placeholder text files. The app will run but won't be accepted by app stores without real images.
